                 Automatically generate autotools files


Autotools are great because they allow you to port easily to any platform, and
solve a number of other problems (like allowing you to modify library paths
of included libraries, or to change the install location at configure time).
They are miserable because they are impossible to setup. This project is
designed to make them easier to use.
