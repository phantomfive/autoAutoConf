Use it any way that makes you happy. Fork it, clone it, rewrite it, use it,

Warning lawyers, beware: there's no warranty, if this or any derivative deletes
all your source, breaks your computer, or steals milk from your refrigerator at
night, or causes any other problem whatsoever, it's your own stupid fault.

Reproduced below is the original Woody Gunthrie copyright, from one of his
recordings:
“This song is Copyrighted in U.S., under Seal of Copyright # 154085, for a 
period of 28 years, and anybody caught singin it without our permission, will 
be mighty good friends of ourn, cause we don’t give a dern. Publish it. Write 
it. Sing it. Swing to it. Yodel it. We wrote it, that’s all we wanted to do.”

The reason for this license is that even proprietary users don't deserve the
pain of using autotools bare.
